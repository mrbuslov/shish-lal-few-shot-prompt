        "input": "I watch TV when I feel tired around my eyes. So about what time does it start? 10 o'clock in the evening. And is it both eyes? Yes. And what are you seeing? Just describe what you're seeing to me. As if I am seeing something under the water. Do you have any pain, headache, anything at the time? No, but next morning I have a bit of a heavy head or headache. And how many times has it happened? A while ago it happened once and then it disappeared and it came back about three weeks ago once and then three more times. like two nights ago, three nights ago. And usually it stays until you go to bed, is that right? Yeah, I don't know, I didn't measure, but around that time I feel tired, especially around my eyes, so I take off my glasses And then I cannot see TV very well, so I go to bed. Okay. Okay. So before I show you things, I'll just show you, first of all, the vision we measured looks fine. Oh. And the tests that we did of your eyes look pretty good. So this is looking at the entire retina. What we're looking at here is the whole retina at the back of the eyes. I see. And everything looks fine. So the optic nerves, the macula, which is the central part of the retina, looks fine. So when I look at the optic nerves in more detail, we take several thousand scans around the optic nerves, green everywhere, one yellow spot, completely normal. And then I look at the macula, which is a central part in more detail, and it looks great. So nice straight line there, little dip in the middle, totally normal. So there's no evidence of macular problems, retinal problems, everything else looks okay. And then, let me have a look here, just take your glasses off. I'll be screwing around. And you've got a tiny bit of early cataract at the front of the eye. There's nothing to worry about. It does not cause surgery. It's fine. On the right eye? In both. In both. I had these glasses made Korea yeah and first time when I got it on sort of a bit busy yes I didn't have enough time so I just departed yes it seems to be okay when you get episodes of both eyes involved they're sort of underwater things it cannot usually be a problem with the back of the eyes. It's not a structural problem. But often it's related to a condition called migraine. Now, it's not typical migraine. Sometimes you can get migraine that just affects the eyes, but you were getting a bit of a headache the next morning. So when we look at that, people try and describe what they get when they get a migraine, and it's all sorts of things. But that kind of underwater, shimmery sort of appearance, They're all different people showing what they get when they get this sort of thing. Yeah, like that. And the fact that it happens for a period of time, the vision's okay before, okay afterwards, suggests to me it's probably just a migraine. Did you get any headaches or things when you were younger? No. So when I looked it up in the internet, it's sort of a condition before the stroke or something. I know, I know. The vast majority are not, but that's not the case. And we don't usually investigate straight away unless it's persisting. The only thing I would do is I'm going to get you back in a few weeks to see how the symptoms are going and also just to do a test of the peripheral vision. That's the only other thing we usually routinely do. But often we find these just settle down by themselves. I think although it is more certain around the periphery but in the centre too. Yes. Yeah. So we'll measure all of that. So, but I usually wait a few weeks just to see what happens. So quite often we get people coming in, they have a few episodes. So we don't do anything. Can you, some people find there's certain triggers. So being very tired or being dehydrated or certain foods, some people find it's associated with that. It sounds like with you, it's often when you're a bit tired, that seems to come on. Yeah. I feel tired around my eyes. Sometimes, in the evening. Yes. Because I watch TV a lot. Yeah. Yes. So I'll see you, I'm just going to see you in three weeks. Obviously if there's any major change, you let me know before then. But an occasional one is fine. I'll see you in three weeks. I'll reassess how your symptoms are going. I'll do that peripheral vision test and then we'll talk again. Yeah. So the eyes are healthy? The eyes are healthy. You've got a little bit of early cataract, nothing to worry about. You don't have macular degeneration. You don't have glaucoma, you don't have any other problems. Your eyes are very good. Okay. So Rebecca, if you see them at your desk, they'll make an appointment for a few weeks' time. Okay. Thank you so much. No, no, no. Take care. I'll see you then. Bye! Diagnosis probable visual migraine. A visual cure to you. Right 6 over 6 corrected. Left 6 over 6 corrected. Next review 3 weeks.",
        "output": "Diagnosis:\nProbable visual migraine\n\n\nCorrected\nVisual Acuity:\tRight: 6/6          \tLeft: 6/6              \n\nPlan:\n3 weeks with visual field tests\n\n\nMany thanks for asking me to see Mrs One.\n\nShe describes episodes of bilateral visual disturbance occurring in the evenings, particularly when tired, characterised by an \"underwater\" appearance to vision. These episodes have occurred several times over the past three weeks, with one previous isolated episode some time ago. She has no other symptoms at the time, but does experience some headache the next morning. There is no prior history of migraine.\n\nOn examination, corrected visual acuity is 6/6 in each eye. The optic nerves and maculae are healthy. There is early bilateral cataract.\n\nGiven the bilateral nature of symptoms, their temporary duration, description of a shimmering appearance and associated headache, these episodes most likely represent ocular migraine.\n\nHowever, I will review Mrs One in three weeks to reassess symptom progression and also to do visual field testing. She will let me know if there are any significant changes in the interim."

        "input": "Okay. Rose, move on. Hello. Hello. Let me have a seat up close. Thank you. All right. So since I saw you last time, there's been a significant reduction of vision in the left eye. Yes. Have you been noticing that? Yes, I have. All right. So I'm going to have a little bit bright, put the bright lights on. I just want to show you everything else first. So first of all, before we look at the cataracts, I'm going to look at the back of the eyes, the retina. So this is the photograph of the retina. You can see it's getting a bit hazy on that side because of the cataract. But the optic nerve, the macula, everything else looks good. So we're going to have a look in more detail at the optic nerve. So with this one, it takes several thousand scans. This is your eye around the optic nerve. It measures the thickness, compares it against people the same age as you, and green air break. So no evidence of glaucoma, which is really good news. And then we look at the macula, which is the central area. We take a cross-sectional view. through the central six mm, and it looks great. Oh, that's good. It's a really nice, straight line there, a little dip in the middle, all looks very normal, because that's a very common cause of fusion loss, you get it for 70 to 80, so it looks great. Yeah, that's very good. Yes, well, I live in a very charming village, so I know all things, and I don't have any objections. Yes, exactly. So, let's take off the property glasses. It's a horrible thought, isn't it? I promise you it's not as bad as it sounds, but you, I can tell you, looking at that, So in your case, it is the cataracts, which is fine because that's fixable. We can fix that. All right. So let me talk to you about what's involved in cataract surgery because I think that's where we're headed. relieved. My son keeps on saying, better get it done now, Martin, before you get any older. Fair enough. I can tell you, I have operated on people who are almost 100 years old. There is definitely no age limit, but yes, I think it's time. Okay, so I'm just going to bring up some of the things that we've So yes, we do the left eye first, and then we do the right eye, because you would notice too much of a difference between the two eyes, because there is a cataract on the right side as well. So if I look at the cross-sectional view that we talked about the back of the eye being fine, this is the front of the eye. Very, very common. It's contained within a transparent bag that is then attached by these strings to the side wall of the eye. So we take the cataract out of the bag and put the new lens into that bag. So the way it's done is that it's a very small incision these days, only 2.4 mm through the side of the cornea. So the whole surgery is done through that incision. And the lens is, as I said, was contained with this bag. So to be able to remove the lens, the first thing I do is make a circuit I'm new lensing. Now the new lens as a large scale model looks like this. So that's the size compared to your finger. That's very hard to see, but contained within that circle is an actual size of these lenses. So there's a central for the rest of your life. I'm getting spoiled here. This is good service, isn't it? That'll keep me going for the rest of the morning. Thank you. But it's foldable, so we can fold it down to a little bit of injective. It stays there for the rest of your life. And how long does that take? So the surgery is a day-only procedure. It is four hours at hospital, half an hour for the surgery itself. After the surgery, The surgery is done under what's called an assisted local anaesthetic. What I mean by that, you won't remember the anaesthetic. No, you won't, guys. During the surgery, you'll have sedation through vein to keep you nice and relaxed. I promise you, you will not see or feel anything that will worry you, but you'll have awareness of your surroundings. Much better for you than a general anaesthetist. Oh, yes. Before I go into that, I'll tell you this. My anaesthetist and I, we worked together for 20 years. We do about 600 cataract operations a year together. The reason I'm telling you that is that every single person comes out and gets it, and it's fine. It's really well tolerated. Now, there's an additional thing I want to talk to you about, which is about the lenses. So the lenses have all changed in the last couple of years. So the lens that I will implant into your eye has ... We used to have lenses which would give you good distance But everything up close was blurred without your glasses. So the modern lenses, so if you had the original, would give you good distance vision. Everything up close is blurred without your glasses. You need glasses for that. The clever scientists have come up with these lenses. It's a very subtle elevation above the surface, right in the centre. What that does is it stretches the light. So the effect of that is that not Actually, it stretches the light, so you've got pretty useful intermediate vision and some near vision as well. So generally, after this surgery, people only need glasses for extended periods of living, low light, additional fine print, and the rest of the time they can't do that. Wow. You mean I'd be able to drive without glasses? Wow. And drive, and do things around the house, all that sort of thing. Yeah, absolutely. So that'd be marvellous. It sounds very trivial, but it is annoying that I have to get up to go over to the television to read the captions. I'll just be able to sit there and get no exercise. Goodness, it's an amazing thing. So we can sort this out for you. Yes. It's come a long, long way. Yes. I know that my husband had long sight, I guess. So where other people were getting glasses because Prince was getting too small, he was taking his glasses off to read. So what that is, that's actually considered short-sighted. So if you can see up close without glasses, that's called short-sighted. And so that's very common as well. And sometimes when you're getting cataract, that actually makes you more short-sighted as well. In the Middle Ages, they used to call it second sight. So people used to say something up close. Reverse. Yes. So do we have to around any holidays at this time? Do you have any in particular? Well, not for me, but my family. We had to know that they weren't going to be away. Yes. I know that the Sydney-based ones are both going to be away in September holidays. Yeah. Okay. Let's have a look. It's lovely being a CP Drink School holder. This is I knew it was quite nice to go away when it's not school holidays. But being in Sydney during school holidays is actually lovely. Everybody's gone. That's right. It's funny, isn't it? Where do you live? In North Taramurra. Would Chatswood or Hornsby be easier for you? I think Chatswood. Whereabouts in Hornsby? It's just near the Westfield. But either is fine. We could, so if I looked at this, September school holidays is, interesting, is from the end of September, towards the end of September. So she would be the most convenient. But she's flying to the UK for something like three or four days in September. It's quite crazy. Let me give you two dates and just see if that works for you. August the 5th, both at Chatswood, August the 5th and Tuesday the 2nd of September. Tuesday the 2nd would probably be easier. good time. And always the fifth? Always the fifth, no. That's too soon. There are things piling up. Okay, fine. So, the other approach we could do... That's Hornsby. That's Chatsworth. Oh, that's Chatsworth. He's Hornsby. I've got more flexibility in Okay, so if that's too soon, what we can do- That's all right. I would say my daughter would be away from the 22nd of September, so she's around in the first part. Okay. So the 1st of September would be fine, but August would be too soon. Is that right? Well, that's just my feeling. August is just two weeks away. Today is the 17th, so one, two, it'd be three weeks' time. I don't mind. There's no urgent situation, so I'll fit in, whatever you want. But we can do it in three weeks' time, can't we? Loretta Kreet Right. We'll just do that then. Just do it. Because the other one would be a month later. It's not as if it's a fortnight, it's just a day. Paul Holmes It's just a day. So I would need your daughter to help on the day of surgery to drop your blood, and the next day to see me for a post-operative check. I then have a one-week So no, we can fix this for you. I will propose those dates. If there's any problems with the dates, I'm so relaxed about time. You just choose. That's great. That's great. That's Chatswood. Chatswood. So that's not so convenient for the daughter-in-law. Oh, okay. But nice, sunny, neutral bay. Yes. Again, I can change it to whatever works for you. We could do exactly the same dates, because I actually operate that day in chats within the morning. Excellent. Most normal activities you can do straight away. So there's an awkward in between phase where whatever you do, one eye's going to be blurred. But there's not that much of a difference in terms of your left eye. So I think you'll manage fine. And very quickly, what we'll probably do is don't worry about the glasses for walking around, and just for reading. And sometimes I'll just get you to get some temporary over-the-counter glasses. So people will manage very well. But you can drive indoors. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I was down to the last one. I'm just looking at the address. You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Thank you.",

        "input": "Thanks. Okay. So Hello, how are you? Come in, have a seat. So let's see, you saw a couple of people in Chatswood, is that right, about the blocked ear duct? Is it still happening? A little bit. Both eyes, or just the right? Both. And what treatment have you none besides having an operation which I decided not to have. He told me that it's not that successful an operation. I can't remember who I saw Okay. So that is very much an elective thinking problem, depending on how much it's worrying you outside of the hospital. Yeah. And tell me about your vision generally. What have you noticed? I think because I always get eyelashes growing in the bottom lid, the inside of my left eye. to get a little bit irritated. I usually, every six months or so, I usually try and get them taken out. And so the rosacea and blepharitis contributes to some of that watering, as you know, as well. Yes, and that's a nightmare, that blepharitis. Do you do anything for that? Yes, you told me to wash with Johnson's Faber shampoo. Does that help? Yes. Okay. of the eye. I just want to show you that everything is very well at the back of the eye. So the entire retina looks fine. So we've had a look at the photographs and this is the right eye, that's the left eye. Everything looks normal. So the peripheral retina, the optic nerve, which takes all the information back to the brain, the macula. This is the cross-sectional view through the macula. It does not show any Then we look at the optic nerve, we'll take several thousand scans around the optic nerves, measure the thickness, green and red, no glaucoma, no nothing, everything's good. So the stuff that you've got that the front jar will be watering fits into the nuisance rather than the vicious threat. It's lucky then that I've just got a nuisance. Exactly, exactly. My little sister, she's actually completely blind. is it a dry and a wet and I can't remember which one's which but she had the injections and the other one you can't do it or maybe have both. She had sort of a little bit of vision left and then she had a beam operation and she said the anaesthetic must have caused completely to go. Well I can reassure you it was perfect. Well my elder sister who's 94. Yes. She has So what I did see on the vision today was the vision has dropped off. So the amount of cataract we've got is enough that would be very reasonable to operate on now, but equally we don't need with, and other people say, look, I'm managing, okay, let's put it off as long as we can. There's no right answer. It's very much up to the individual. How are you feeling about it? My husband's had one done, just the one eye. He's like me, he's got a short-sighted and a long-sighted eye, doesn't usually wear glasses. Paul Is that right, both of you? That's unusual. Loretta I thought, gosh, he's got it as well. It must be just common sense. Paul No, that's really quite unusual, yes. Loretta Yes, so neither of us wear glasses. I eventually went to OPSM, or I don't know, sometime between when I saw you last and now, and got glasses for driving, which I don't need yet, I've been told. But I find, particularly in the shadows, I find when I'm driving, I love to be able to see the holes, et cetera. I find I can read the newspaper all right, as long as I've got a good light source. So it sounds to me like you're managing okay. What do I want to do in this situation is if you're managing fine, maybe just to make a book an appointment for 12 months, you can decide if it But it's important to understand, the cataract's not doing any harm to your eye or the other structures of the eye. It's not going to make it technically more difficult for me to do later, and the end result is the same. So I'm very relaxed about time. I'll think about it. You say both eyes meet. Yes. And it's a day-only procedure, one eye done, four hours at the hospital. I see you the next day, you have a patch on the night, I see you the next day. Most normal activities you can do straight away. I've just had a big operation back for L4, L5 with that fusion. That's a big operation. Yes, so unfortunate. While we do this, I'm very happy with your health over your eyes. You've got cataract I will make an appointment to see you in 12 months, but if you decide early you want to get done, just let us know, and I'll see you before. Yes. It's not a good time, anyhow, really. Normally, because just when I'm going skiing, not this year, of course, since I've just had back operation. But, well, three months now since I've had it, but I'll get water. I found something in here that I'm limping now more than I did after. the operation that usually February, February and July, August, January, February, July, August. That's when we go skiing, which I'm not doing this year, unfortunately. Hopefully in February. Jeff talks about doing anything more fundamental than that, or sometimes he does in some ways. Do you talk about that a lot? same place all along. There's quite a few, so I'll just take a picture afterwards. I'll just bring it forward a little bit. And I can see a really, really big hair. and recognise that we stick. Well, one thing which I've hit me of as well, because I do cry. It's a nice diagnosis, this blepharitis, that's when they seem to grow. It's exactly what happens to orcapsis, the blepharitis causes inflammation. It distorts where the eyelashes have gone. It's all related to the nose action as well. I'll see you in 12 months. I'm happy to see you. stopped the terrible tearing. It was as though I was really, really crying hysterically. You know, it was just when I went to see them in Chatswood, I didn't know you dealt with that as well. I thought you were maybe bacular and carotax. No, I don't usually deal with that sort of stuff. Yeah. Yeah, but we do have got to see if that's evident. So I don't know if We don't have a lot of evidence for it. I think these are the sorts of things it's worth while trying these things and seeing if it helps your condition. But otherwise, your eyes are very healthy. As I said, it's all on the surface inside the eyes that you're very healthy. Cataract is a fixable problem. One day we'll fix it. Yes. I'm not concerned because I've noticed when I'm dry. Yes. Yeah, I can certainly see some people with cataract. So I would be happy Sometimes they can progress a bit fast, but honestly, you will know. Come in. Just about the interplay patients. I saw that you wrote early right eye, early phase right eye. Do you need any pre-fall shots or just central? Just central. Just central. And we can dilate on arrival, yes? Yes.
